=== MEMPHIS DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT - V1.0 (C) MEMPHIS ===

Overview:

Memphis Desktop Environment is a simple user interface that allows the facilitation of multitasking, as well as windowed applications with the ability to Maximize, Minimize and drag around the screen. You'll find it very easy and comforting to use the MDE, but before that, we need to install it.

Package Hierarchy: (This shows you the different dependencies that'll be installed.)

 +- mde.pkg - Core package for MDE. Install first using "packinstall "mde.pkg"
 |
 +--- exodus.pkg - Updated version of the Exodus File Browser, compatible with the MDE.
 +--- packstore.pkg - Updated Package Store application for MDE.


How to install:

You will need the BATCH Scripting Language for this to work.

When you have the BATCH package, run the "install.bat" file with the "batch" command. It will then unpack everything, and you'll be good to go.
