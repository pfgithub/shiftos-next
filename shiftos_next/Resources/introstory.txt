Hello, user. My name is The Ultimate Hacker.
I am developing a distro of the Disk Operating System for modern computers called "UltraDOS".
I don't want to reveal my full intentions, nor my true identity.
Currently, UltraDOS is very minimal, and only supports text-based applications.
Due to lack of the hardware to run UltraDOS on, I've decided to use your PC for testing purposes.
I'm now formatting the hard drive to setup UltraDOS on.
